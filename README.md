# Accommodation Finder Project

This project aims to help students find the best accommodation by clustering accommodations based on their amenities, budget, and proximity to preferred locations.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to classify accommodations and suggest suitable options for students based on their preferences. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
